# University Management System  

A comprehensive system designed to manage teacher and student records for universities, implemented entirely in **C language**. This project includes an **Admin Panel**, **Teacher's Panel**, and **Student's Panel**, leveraging **functions**, **file handling**, and **pointers** for robust operations and efficient data management.

## Features  

### Admin Panel  
1. **Login System**  
   - Secure login for admins using function-based authentication and file handling.

2. **Create Teacher and Student Accounts**  
   - Add teacher and student records, stored persistently in files.

3. **Update Teacher and Student Information**  
   - Edit existing records using functions, pointers, and file management.

4. **Assign Courses to Teachers**  
   - Allocate courses to teachers, managed through functions and file storage.

### Teacher's Panel  
1. **Login System**  
   - Authentication for teachers using function-based validation and file handling.

2. **Provide Class Test Marks**  
   - Input and save class test marks for students using file management.

3. **Find Students by First Name**  
   - Search for student records by their first name, implemented with functions, pointers, and file operations.

4. **Count Students**  
   - Calculate and display the total number of registered students using file processing.

### Student's Panel  
1. **Login System**  
   - Secure login for students using functions and file-based authentication.

2. **Check Class Test Marks**  
   - Students can view their class test marks, retrieved from file storage through function-based operations.
